# Form Challenge (React)

Imagine for the next [time interval], that you are a developer at ùì¶ickedùì£ickets. The attached React ticket order form has been working in production for a while, but Product has some tickets for you to implement, to improve its functionality.

Your tasks will be to implement as many of the below requested changes, IN ORDER, as you comfortably can in the allotted time.

Include at the bottom of this README a short description of the changes you made for each issue you fixed. Explain briefly what visible effect to the user your fix will have.

Notes: If you have notes on other issues you would change, make note of them, but don't include them in your solutions.

ùì¶ICKEDùì£ICKETS ORDER FORM TASKS

1. Show a spinner, or text change that shows that the form is submitting.
2. Prevent a double-submission of the form.
3. The QR code encodes only the seat information, but renders even when gratuity changes. Prevent the OrderQR component from rendering on changes to the gratuity.
4. Analytics events (see the analytics.ts) have been arriving out of order at the analytics server due to intermittent network conditions. See analytics.ts and DO NOT change the hard-coded delays in it. Ensure that each analytics event is not put on the network until a reply is received from the server.
